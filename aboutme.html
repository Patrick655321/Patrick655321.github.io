            <h2>So, who am I?</h2>
            <p>With nearly 20 years experience in hospitality I feel it is time to leave the industry and have so decided my next adventure will be in to the wild world of coding. Currently completing a <a href="https://www.coderacademy.edu.au/">Coder Academy</a> bootcamp, I aim to be ready to break out into the real world within 12 months.</p>
            <p>I have always had an interest in learning and problem solving so it seems like a natural progression, right? Anyway, enough about my motivations, let's talk about what makes me me.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include rock climbing, motorcycles, reading, writing and fitness. Taht's all well and good but what I really love is spending time out having dinner with friends. Perhaps a throwback to my hospo roots, I enjoy the decadence of a good meal and what I find more nourishing than even that is the company of those I hold dear.</p>
            <p>I enjoy all kinds of music, although my go-to coding music is slow blues. Riding on beautiful melodies, riding the peaks of those solid guitar licks and feeling the depths of those gravelly voices gives me a certain feeling of flow taht I find conducive to a good session at my PC</p>
