                So I have been at the <a href="https://asrc.org.au/">ASRC</a> for a while now but due to COVID19 the community kitchen has been closed. Well, I am pleased to say we are back open and cooking with gas! Aliyah has been in teaching us how to make traditional Palestinian dishes from her home and wowsers, what a treat! With an eggplant moussaka, tahini chicken, daal and some jewelled rice we eat well these days.

                What kind of bartender isn't a little bit of a showpony eh? Making bespoke blazers people at their tables adds to the entertainemnt factor of my work. Of course, I'd never take it too far now, would I? Not me, no, not me ever! </sbr>
