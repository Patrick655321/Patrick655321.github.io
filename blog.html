                So I have been at the <a href="https://asrc.org.au/">ASRC</a> for a while now but due to COVID19 the community kitchen has been closed. Well, I am pleased to say we are back open and cooking with gas! Aliyah has been in teaching us how to make traditional Palestinian dishes from her home and wowsers, what a treat! With an eggplant moussaka, tahini chicken, daal and some jewelled rice we eat well these days.

                What kind of bartender isn't a little bit of a showpony eh? Making bespoke blazers people at their tables adds to the entertainemnt factor of my work. Of course, I'd never take it too far now, would?
