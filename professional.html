        <h2>What have I been up to?</h2>
        <p>For the past almost 20 years I have been a hospitality worker and occasional body modifier. While I have stepped away from the body modification game for the time being while I focus on other ventures you can still see a small sample of my work <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/piercer_pat/?hl=en">here</a>.</p>
        <p>In the hospitality industry I have worked for some heavy hitters such as <a href="https://www.lucas.online/">The Lucas Group</a> and <a href="https://retailsavvygroup.com/">Retail Savvy Group</a>. I also have had the good fortune to work for some more bespoke venues such as <a href="https://hawthornlounge.co.nz/"> Hawthorn Lounge</a> in New Zealand, which took out the award for Cocktail Experience of the Year in 2018 with me as the GM, as well as The Burlesque Bar (Closed) where I originally cut my teeth in cocktails, sound and lighting.
        <p>A bartender with a penchant for entertaining and a creative streak that extends beyond cocktails, I found myself also taking care of a lot of stock control for The Lucas Group and as such developed an interest in how the programs worked. Realising a growing passion for problem solving and streamlining processes, I have finally made the leap into coding!</p>
        <p>For a more detailed and extensive list of my work experience please check out my <a href="./resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> and feel free to <a href="mailto: 12684@Coderacademy.edu.au" target="_blank">email me</a> with any questions.</p>
        <h2>Work at the ASRC</h2>
        <p>One of the best decisions I have made in recent years was to join the ranks of volunteers engaged with <a href="https://asrc.org.au/">The Asylum Seeker Resource Center</a>, preparing hto meals and occasionally packing food for the members.</br>
           An organisation that has been around for over 20 years, the ASRC is Australia's largest human rights organisation for refugees and asylum seekers. I am but a small cog in this very big vehicle, however this work and the people I have met through the organisation have been a source of great inspiration for my day to day. If you haven't checked them out yet I'd strongly recommend you have a look at what they're up to! Please see the link above or if you have any questions about what i do specifically feel free to <a href="mailto: 12684@Coderacademy.edu.au" target="_blank">contact me</a> to discuss.</p>
